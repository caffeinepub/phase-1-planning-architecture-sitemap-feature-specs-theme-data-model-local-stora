Use existing layout/components already in use on this page (PageLayout, FadeInSection) and a shadcn/ui container (e.g., Card and/or Alert) to match the established theme. Ensure the announcement text is inserted exactly as provided (including punctuation, line breaks, and the ✨) and rendered with appropriate Tailwind utility classes (e.g., whitespace-preserving) so formatting remains readable on mobile/desktop. Verify the component's usage instructions before implementing."
