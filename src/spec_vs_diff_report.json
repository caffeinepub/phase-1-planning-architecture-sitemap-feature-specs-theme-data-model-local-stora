  "summary": "Services page was updated to use MysticalBorder-wrapped sections and includes the new “Enchanted Services...” intro plus at least the first two categories. However, the diff is truncated, so it’s not possible to verify that *all* required categories/bullets and the closing bordered invitation are present and that *all* text matches the provided copy exactly. Two additional non-requested metadata/docs tracking files were also modified.",

      "reason": "The Services page diff is truncated after the start of the “👑 Fashion & Enchanted Accessories” section, so the presence/accuracy of the remaining required categories, bullet lines, and the final closing paragraph cannot be confirmed from the provided evidence. Also cannot fully verify that *all* old artifact-focused content was removed.",

      "requirement": "Individually enclose each major part of the new Services page (intro block, each of the 8 category blocks, and the closing invitation paragraph) in MysticalBorder styling with consistent responsive behavior (no overflow/clipping).",
      "reason": "Intro and at least the first two category sections are wrapped in MysticalBorder, but the diff truncation prevents verification that all remaining category blocks and the closing invitation paragraph are each individually bordered, and that responsive overflow/clipping is handled across all sections.",
