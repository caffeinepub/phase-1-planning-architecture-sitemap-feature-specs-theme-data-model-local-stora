  "summary": "Diff implements several Phase 5 polishing items: standardized animation utilities with reduced-motion support, route-level code-splitting via React.lazy/Suspense, improved offline sync status UI with a queue management dialog, and stronger error-state UI used in at least Shop and Dashboard. However, some requirements are only partially evidenced (notably per-route SEO meta handling and explicit image lazy-loading/sizing), and several new UI sections/components and docs appear that were not requested in the BuildRequest.",

      "id": "REQ-36",
      "requirement": "When queued mutation replay fails, the UI indicates how many actions remain queued and presents an English explanation that includes whether the failure is retryable (transient) vs non-retryable (permanent).",
      "reason": "Offline sync UI shows remaining count and error text, and replay logic classifies errors as retryable/non-retryable, but the shown UI text does not clearly surface whether a failure is retryable vs permanent.",
