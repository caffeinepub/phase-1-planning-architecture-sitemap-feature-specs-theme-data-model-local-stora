  "summary": "The diff does not include the portion of Contact.tsx where the social-media bubbles are defined, so there is no visible evidence that the required href targets, new-tab attributes, or clickable/hover/focus bubble styling were implemented. Additionally, metadata/state files were modified that were not requested in the BuildRequest.",

      "requirement": "Update the social-media bubble links on the Contact page so that clicking each bubble opens the exact user-provided social profile URL in a new tab (Facebook/YouTube/TikTok/Instagram), keeping target=\"_blank\" and rel=\"noopener noreferrer\".",
      "reason": "The provided Contact.tsx diff is truncated before any social-media bubble/link markup; no evidence shows the specified href values or target/rel attributes were added/updated.",

      "reason": "The truncated diff does not show any social icon link elements or their className/aria-label/focus/hover styling, so there is no confirmable implementation evidence.",
