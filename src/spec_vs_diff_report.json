  "summary": "Diff adds centralized route constants, updates router paths to include /lore -> BlogLore, adds explicit Admin link in header, updates Admin access submission flow to immediately navigate to /admin on “Access Granted”, and introduces an Admin access gate plus improved Admin dashboard shell/sidebar/topbar. However, several requested acceptance criteria cannot be confirmed from the truncated diff summary (notably specific AdminAccess UI text, backend “Access Granted” exact return behavior, and completion of the QA checklist/site-wide audit).",

      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Perform a full-site audit and fix all runtime errors, broken navigation/links, layout overlaps, styling conflicts, and script/JS conflicts across every page and component.",
      "reason": "The diff shows multiple targeted changes (routing constants, header/footer links, admin flow, admin dashboard components), but does not provide evidence that *every* route/component has been audited and fixed, nor that there are no remaining console errors/overlaps across the whole site.",

      "requirement": "Admin access screen label must read “Administrator Access” and button must read “Submit”.",
      "reason": "AdminAccess.tsx is truncated before the rendered form markup, so the required user-facing label/button text cannot be verified from the provided diff summary.",

      "requirement": "Backend admin access verification continues to accept code 7583A (case-insensitive) and returns the exact string “Access Granted” on success.",
      "reason": "backend/main.mo is truncated and does not show the admin access verification function implementation or its exact returned text; only the constant ADMIN_ACCESS_CODE is visible.",
