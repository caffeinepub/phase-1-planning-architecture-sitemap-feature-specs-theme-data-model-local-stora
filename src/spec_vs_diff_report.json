  "summary": "Diff adds a new announcement Card near the top of `frontend/src/pages/Shop.tsx`, above the shop content, using existing UI components (Card, PageLayout, FadeInSection). However, based on the truncated snippet, the announcement text does not clearly match the provided wording exactly (no visible ending ✨ and the body text appears truncated/typoed).",

      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Announcement text must be displayed exactly as provided (including punctuation and the ✨).",
      "reason": "In the shown `Shop.tsx` snippet, the title uses an ellipsis character (\"The Shop is Awakening…\") and the body text appears cut off/typoed (\"Facebook Messenge\"), and there is no visible ending ✨ in the provided excerpt. With only this diff evidence, exact text fidelity cannot be confirmed and appears violated.",
