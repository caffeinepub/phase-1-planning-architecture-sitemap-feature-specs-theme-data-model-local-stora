  "summary": "Diff adds a new centralized quotes data file, random quote selection utility + hook, and a RandomQuotes component rendered globally via AppLayout. About page copy was updated to “The Creator of Side Quests” branding and includes Mission/Vision sections, but the requested verbatim user-provided narrative/mission/vision text cannot be confirmed from the diff and appears to be newly written. Random quote selection is non-repeating but currently always returns 3 quotes (not 2–3). Several unrelated UI/style changes were also made (HeaderNav behavior and large global CSS updates).",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-53",
      "requirement": "Replace /about content with the user-provided “The Creator of Side Quests” About page copy, keeping the provided narrative text verbatim and including clearly labeled Mission Statement and Vision Statement matching the user-provided wording exactly.",
      "reason": "The About page content shown appears to be freshly authored/paraphrased copy rather than an inserted verbatim user-provided narrative block; Mission/Vision text is truncated in the diff so exact-match to user-provided wording cannot be verified.",

      "requirement": "Ensure the random selection utility returns 2–3 non-repeating quotes per page render/load.",

      "requirement": "Update the centralized quotes data source to contain exactly the user-provided quotes (exact wording and punctuation).",
      "reason": "Although `frontend/src/data/quotes.ts` contains 10 quotes, the BuildRequest’s exact user-provided quotes are not included in the diff summary, so exact text/punctuation matching cannot be verified from the provided evidence.",
