  "summary": "Scope shift to building a premium-quality, mobile-optimized business website branded as “The Creator of Side Quests” with a fantasy-medieval–meets–modern-luxury-chic aesthetic and neurodivergent-centered copy. Add/replace page content (especially About) with provided verbatim narrative plus Mission/Vision, expand homepage and core business sections (services, portfolio, testimonials, newsletter, booking CTAs), and update the randomized quotes feature to display 2–3 quotes per page including the About page (conflicting with the earlier About-page exclusion rule). Also address a prior deployment error and redeploy after ensuring quotes appear across pages.",

    "Planned pages include: Homepage, About, Services, Shop, Dashboard, Contact, Blog/Lore, FAQ, Admin, and Legal pages.",
    "Design direction target: dark fantasy aesthetic with parchment tones and glowing accents.",
    "Backend/data layer planned around Supabase with core tables such as Users, Inventory, Products, Orders, Saved Artifacts.",
    "Local storage to cache items like recently viewed content, offline edits, and session state.",
    "Phase 2 scope targets a real Supabase-backed backend (project setup, DB schema, auth/roles, and sync) rather than only planning artifacts.",
    "Phase 3 UI scope includes global layout components (nav/footer/grid/theme), page-specific section layouts, and interactive effects (hover/flip/fade/parallax/smooth transitions).",
    "Phase 4 direction: core functionality will be Supabase-backed (auth, product data, wishlist/saved artifacts, orders/guild management) with local-storage-based caching/offline-first behaviors and sync when online.",
    "Phase 5 scope: advanced UI animations/interactions (flip cards, hover glows, scroll-based fade-ins) while maintaining performance and accessibility (e.g., reduced motion).",
    "Phase 5 scope: robust error handling for offline scenarios, failed API calls, and syncing conflicts (clear user feedback + recovery).",
    "Phase 5 scope: performance + quality pass including lazy loading, caching, bundle-size reduction, responsive testing, and accessibility/SEO improvements."
