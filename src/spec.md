# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Replace the Services page content with the provided “Enchanted Services of The Creator of Side Quests” copy and ensure all major sections use the site’s consistent bordered styling.

**Planned changes:**
- Remove the current artifact-focused Services page content (including any existing services list/accordion) and replace it entirely with the provided “Enchanted Services of The Creator of Side Quests” text (including all headings, emoji, bullets, and closing invitation), preserving exact wording/punctuation aside from necessary layout formatting.
- Wrap the intro/title area, each service category section (🌿, 👑, 📜, 🎁, 🌈, 🎉, 🛠️, 🎨), and the closing invitation paragraph in the existing bordered styling pattern (MysticalBorder) so each block is individually enclosed and remains visually consistent across responsive breakpoints.

**User-visible outcome:** Visiting `/services` shows the new “Enchanted Services of The Creator of Side Quests” content only, with each major section presented inside consistent bordered containers across mobile, tablet, and desktop.
