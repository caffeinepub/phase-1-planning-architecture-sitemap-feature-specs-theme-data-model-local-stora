# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Display a “Shop is Awakening” announcement at the top of the public Shop page while keeping the existing shop UI fully functional.

**Planned changes:**
- Add the provided announcement message (exact text, including punctuation and ✨) to `frontend/src/pages/Shop.tsx`.
- Render the announcement near the top of the Shop page content area, above existing shop controls/products, using existing layout/components and theme styling.

**User-visible outcome:** When visiting the Shop page, users see the full “Shop is Awakening…” announcement at the top of the page, with the rest of the shop controls/products and cart behavior unchanged on mobile and desktop.
