# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Ensure all user-facing labels and headings consistently use “Lore and Knowledge” across the site and admin dashboard.

**Planned changes:**
- Update the top navigation link text to display exactly “Lore and Knowledge” (replace any “Lore & Knowledge” variants).
- Update the Lore page at route “/lore” to render the page title/primary heading exactly as “Lore and Knowledge”, and adjust any related intro text that uses the page/tab label.
- Update the Admin Dashboard left sidebar tab label to exactly “Lore and Knowledge” and remove any user-facing “Lure and knowledge” typos.

**User-visible outcome:** Users see a consistent “Lore and Knowledge” label in the site navigation, on the Lore page, and in the admin sidebar, with no remaining “Lore & Knowledge” or “Lure and knowledge” text in the UI.
